## Introduction

This is a game that we have played at work a couple of months ago. I think it's better to turn it into a simple app.

## Rules for this challenge:

1. Put in 400k/month into the common fund. My bank account: Techcombank Vu Long 19029687010018 (1k = 1VND)
2. Write your weekly goal. Example: write 1 blog everyday (Trang), spend 1 hours learning something every (Long), Do 15 minutes of stretching everyday (Harley). It doesn't have to be everyday, can be something 3/5 times a week for example.
3. Everytime you finish performing your task, send the result/update here.
4. Goals keeper (me in this first month) will keep track and do sum report every week. Whoever doesn't meet the goal will lose 100k/week. This money will go into our Challenge Fund. We will decide what to do with this fund later
